# BrainFlix

BrainFlix project was one of the assignments that I've done at BrainStation, which helped me to understand Sass(style rules, variables, mixins, and etc), Postman, API requests(with the mock API server), and much more. All pages are responsive in different breakpoints such as mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints.
